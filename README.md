# E-Learning-Platform
Built an e-Learning platform by creating a custom content management system (CMS) which allows instructors to create courses and manage their contents.

The platform offers courses in various subjects. Each course can be divided into a configurable number of modules, and each module contains a configurable number of contents. There can be contents of various types: text, file, image, or video.

Also integrated RESTful API with JSON serialization (using Django REST Framework).

The functions API provided were: Retrieve Subjects, retrieve available courses, retrieve course contents and enroll in course. By building this API, I learned how to create and interface for other services to interact with the web application.

Technologies used: Python 2.7, Django web framework, django REST framework, HTML, CSS, SQL database, JavaScript, Json, RESTful API.
